# Final Capstone Project

This project involved two stages, NLP_1, involved looking through various scenarios and identifying what NLP (Natural Language Processing) model would be used in it. The scenarios ranged from medical diagnosis to exam paper marking.

The second project, NLP_2, was to look up and find an innovative use of NLP currently. I chose to look at the use of NLP by Alexa by Amazon as it was of interest to me. I wrote a brief 500 words on how it works and processes speech into actions.
